    // When complete, this program will ask the user how many roller coaster rides
    // they'd like to go on, then execute a block of code that many times.
    // The block will output which "ride" they're on, and change which image
    // is displayed on the page. The images shown will cycle through a list
    // of possible sources, though this happens so quickly that the user will only see
    // the final one shown.

    // There are explanatory comments thoughout. The work that still needs to be done
    // is noted in TODO comments. Please complete this work.

    // EXTRA CHALLENGES:
    // 1. Using JS, add a class of "red" to the <h1>.
    //    This only needs to be done once, so code should be outside loop. 
    // 2. Execute the loop only half as many times, or twice as many times, as the user requested.
    // 3. Add a pause to each loop, so user can see each image as it cycles past.
    //    This is a difficult one!
